To test our hypothesized relationships, we drew upon a sample of 383 ventures taken directly from Kickstarter, coupled with a decision experiment conducted in a simulated crowdfunding context. Results suggest that issue-relevant information, such as entrepreneurs' education, matters most when funders possess greater ability and motivation to make careful evaluations. In contrast, cues, such as adopting a group identity, have their strongest influence among inexperienced, first-time funders, and when requested funding amounts are smaller.},

The current paper investigates the underlying reasons for the latter finding. Two experiments are reported, where subjects memorized text--picture stimuli that differed in the specificity of information contained in either sentences or pictures. In a subsequent picture recognition test, subjects showed no integration effect after a 30-minute delay (Experiments 1 and 2), but only after a 1-week delay (Experiment 2). Furthermore, eye-tracking data showed that participants sufficiently processed the pictures during learning (Experiment 1). This data pattern speaks in favor of the assumption that after a short delay participants had available a short-lived pictorial surface representation, which masked the integration effect for pictorial recognition.Copyright {\copyright} 2015 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

Using a data set of 7.4 million reviews associated with 3.5 million photos from Yelp, and applying machine learning algorithms, the authors quantify the similarity of the content between text and photos. They find that, overall, photos increase the helpfulness of a review. More importantly, though, greater similarity between photos and text heightens review helpfulness more. The authors then validate algorithm-based similarity assessments with similarity perceptions of human judges. Using real-world reviews from Yelp and carefully designed stimuli, they replicate the core findings in five laboratory experiments. Further, testing the underlying mechanism, they find that greater similarity facilitates the ease with which consumers can process the review, which, in turn, increases that review's helpfulness to consumers. Finally, they show that factors that impede the ease of processing (e.g., language difficulty or poor image quality) can reduce the effect of similarity on helpfulness. These findings provide novel insights into the value of user-generated content that includes text and photos and its underlying mechanism.},

Given the nature of crowdfunding environments (intrinsically motivated stakeholders) and Kickstarter's rewards-based structure, we hypothesize that there is a potential crowding-out effect in which an increased level of money saliency leads to decreased funding contributions and engagement. However, this effect should be weaker among projects that have non-selfish aims or intentions. Our analysis on close to 80,000 Kickstarter campaigns confirms that there is indeed a price to pay for using monetary-related terms in project descriptions but not among projects identified as sustainability oriented.},

The empirical evidence shows that the amount of punctuation is negatively associated with the funding probability and borrowing rate. We propose that the usage of punctuation affects the readability of a loan description and reflects borrowers' self-control and cognitive ability. Within a given number of words, excessive usage of punctuation makes loan description informal and reduces the readability of the text, thereby impairing investors' trust in borrowers. Moreover, borrowers that overuse punctuation may have lower ability of self-control, and tend to underestimate the risk of borrowing and offer lower borrowing rate due to overconfidence.},

To gain insight into how Internet users perceive human images as one element of website design, a controlled experiment was con ducted using a questionnaire, interviews, and eye-tracking methodology. Three conditions of human images were created including human images with facial features, human images without facial features, and a control condition with no human images. It was expected that human images with facial features would induce a user to perceive the website as more appealing, having warmth or social presence, and as more trustworthy. In turn, higher levels of image appeal and perceived social presence were predicted to result in trust. All expected relationships in the model were supported except no direct relationship was found between the human image conditions and trust. Additional analyses revealed subtle dif ferences in the perception of human images across cultures (Canada, Germany, and Japan). While the general impact of human images seems universal across country groups, based on interview data four concepts emerged?aesthetics, symbolism, affective property, andfunctional property?with participants from each culture focusing on different concepts as applied to website design.

We set the disciplines in the search strategy to select studies related to crowdfunding success. Ultimately, 94 empirical papers are selected to reveal the different findings for the determinants of crowdfunding success; based on this information, we construct an integrated framework for future research. There has been much research on project- and creator-related factors; however, many of these factors have inconsistent relationships with crowdfunding success due to varying measurements of success. In particular, different measurements used within the same study for determinants or crowdfunding success may also produce inconsistent results. In addition, different crowdfunding models of a project have been found to induce additional findings. Our review of the determinants of crowdfunding success and the definitions of the determinants, as well as the proposed integrated framework, can help focus future work on relatively new or unique determinants rarely addressed in the existing literature.

  abstract = {Charity fundraising is becoming increasingly reliant on online platforms such as crowdfunding platforms. However, overwhelmingly, crowdfunding campaigns are not meeting their goals. Therefore, it is imperative to examine how the success of charity fundraising campaigns can be improved. In this paper, we focus on the design of project images on a crowdfunding website, which portray the themes and content of the projects. Employing the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model, we investigate the relationships between image attributes (S) and image emotions (O), and between image emotions (O) and campaign outcomes (R). We developed and trained a deep neural network model to identify the emotions conveyed in the images, and then implemented it to analyze project images from a popular crowdfunding platform. We applied the obtained image emotions together with the objective image attributes and the project outcome metrics to explore from a design perspective, what image attributes evoke image emotions, and how image emotions are related to the success of charity fundraising projects. Our results confirm these relationships and further suggest that the roles of image emotions on the success of crowdfunding campaigns vary with project characteristics such as the project budget and category. In addition, the image emotions of competing projects on the crowdfunding platform were found to reduce the project's performance. In an extended study, we conducted an online randomized controlled experiment by manipulating image attributes to reexamine the causal relationships and verify the mediating roles of positive and negative empathies between image emotions and campaign outcomes. This research contributes to the charity fundraising literature from a novel perspective of emotions in project images. It presents new and unique findings regarding the mediation roles of positive and negative empathies and the limitations of the emotion of sadness in certain types of charity fundraising. In addition, our findings provide useful insights for practitioners seeking to design successful online charity campaigns.},

  abstract = {Abstract             In recent years, entrepreneurs have increasingly turned to crowdfunding, a new form of entrepreneurial finance, to fund projects. Whilst research has shown that signals originating from the entrepreneur and project can affect the outcome of crowdfunding, how different signals work together under different signalling environments remains underexplored. Drawing on signalling theory, we examine how signals of entrepreneurs' credibility (success, failure, backer and industry experience) and project quality (preparedness and third-party endorsements) produce crowdfunding success in different signalling environments. We collected a unique dataset with matched projects listed on both Kickstarter and Indiegogo, but with different funding models, to represent two distinct signalling environments. Results based on qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) identify two distinct signalling patterns that show entrepreneur's credibility and project quality signals can complement each other to produce crowdfunding success. In an environment with less uncertainty, entrepreneur's credibility in terms of crowdfunding experience can also compensate absent project quality to produce crowdfunding success. In an environment with higher uncertainty, entrepreneur's credibility and project quality need to be both present to establish the necessary legitimacy for crowdfunding to be successful. Furthermore, by integrating positive (i.e. success) and negative (i.e. failure) signals, we demonstrate how signal incongruence can enhance crowdfunding success.                            Plain English Summary               Failure experience is an important signal in achieving crowdfunding success, but its effectiveness depends on other signals as well as the signalling environment. Our study shows how crowdfunding success can be achieved in multiple ways and that the path to success depends on the funding model of the platform used. For entrepreneurs to demonstrate credibility, backer experience and project preparedness are important. Both are under the control of the entrepreneur and well worth considering investing effort into. Importantly, the study also shows that demonstrating failure experience is important in achieving crowdfunding success. Failure experience can either replace the lack of prior success experience by demonstrating a track record of learning or it can enhance prior success experience by producing a more realistic picture of the entrepreneurs. Thus, the study offers practical implications for entrepreneurs on how to use different signals to increase the likelihood of success in reward-based crowdfunding.},

Our study emphasizes the need to understand crowdfunding from an investor's perspective. Linguistic styles in crowdfunding campaigns that aim to trigger excitement or are aimed at inclusiveness are better predictors of campaign success than firm-level determinants. At the contrary, higher uncertainty perceptions about the state of product development may substantially reduce evaluations of new products and reduce purchasing intentions among potential funders. Our findings emphasize that positive psychological language is salient in environments where objective information is scarce and where investment preferences are taste based. Employing enthusiastic language or showing the product in action may capture an individual's attention. Using all technology and design-related crowdfunding campaigns launched on Kickstarter, our study underscores the need to align potential consumers' expectations with the visualization and presentation of the crowdfunding campaign.},

The successful funding of crowdfunding campaigns is important for founders, investors, platform operators, and diverse interest groups as well. As a consequence, research has already shed light on some success factors of crowdfunding campaigns, but the interrelations between the success factors have been neglected so far. Building upon previous research in the field of crowdfunding, investment decision making, and signaling theory, we propose a research model to explain crowdfunding success considering success factors and their interrelations. Our findings reveal that not only the factors themselves but also their interrelations are important to explain funding success. Our results are highly relevant for the stakeholders on crowdfunding platforms in order to prepare and identify successful project proposals.},

  abstract = {Background: Short-form videos, characterised by their brevity, have become immensely popular on social media platforms, captivating users with engaging content in a short amount of time. However, their addictive nature and impact on attention span can lead to frustration and difficulty concentrating on longer tasks. Aim: This study makes use of qualitative data to investigate how people report on perceived short-form video effects on attention span and mood.  Method: The research design consisted out of 15 semi-structured interviews. Young people, ranging from 19 to 24 years old, living either in the Netherlands or Germany have participated within the study. The study was split into three parts: First participants had to watch short-form videos for a duration of 7 minutes, which was followed by a Stroop test which measured the attention of participants. After that, interviews have been held in which the participants discussed own social media behaviour, short-form video consumption behaviour and potential effects of short-form videos on attention span and mood in a personal and societal scope.  Results: The study found that participants spent about an hour per day watching short-form videos and acknowledged their addictive nature. While immediate effects on attention span were not apparent, participants reported feeling less focused in their daily lives and recognised a connection between short-form video consumption and attention span. Mood was negatively affected when participants struggled to concentrate, but overall, the reported impact on mood was not significant. The participants mainly observed a link between short-form videos, attention span, and mood in others. Conclusion: The study revealed that short-form videos can affect attention span and mood. Immediate effects on attention span were not observed but participants reported feeling less concentrated in their daily lives. The cycle of disappointment presents how mood and attention span of the participants are affected by short-form videos, however they were not able to recognise a significant effect on their mood in their day-to-day life. Participants experienced difficulties in reporting about their own perceived effects, therefore further research is needed to explore the interconnected nature of mood and attention span in relation to short-form video consumption.  Implications: Individuals should be more aware of their social media usage and engage in self-regulation, while schools and policymakers can implement awareness programs and regulations on social media platforms. Additionally, providing mental health support and resources is crucial for those experiencing negative effects from excessive social media usage.

To do this effectively, they consciously or unconsciously use several impression management techniques. Based on human and automated (AI-based analysis) of technology-related videos, we determine which impression management techniques help crowdfunding creators to attract a higher number of backers and meet their financial targets. Our results indicate that self-presentation and exemplification techniques are positively associated with crowdfunding success, while intimidation is negatively related to crowdfunding success. Our findings show that automated analysis of videos using advanced AI can replace human coding since measures based on human coding become insignificant when AI-based measures are included in the analysis. This illustrates the insights companies can create through the large scale automated analysis of video content using AI, including outside of a crowdfunding context.},

It is also beneficial to sustainable financing. What is more, the success of crowdfunding projects facilitates the sustainable development of those growing enterprises. In this study, from the perspective of information communication and based on information asymmetry and signaling theory, we identify three dimensions of information description, including information quantity (word count, picture count and video count), information attitude (as measured by comment), and information quality (readability and update). We empirically examine their direct effects on crowdfunding success and the moderating effect of information attitude using binary logistic regression. Data (N = 7207) is collected from Kickstarter, a popular crowdfunding platform. The results reveal that when considering these three dimensions of information description together, word count is associated with crowdfunding success in an inverted-U shape. Picture count, video count, comment, and update have positive effects on crowdfunding success. In contrast, readability is negatively related to crowdfunding success. In addition, we find that comment negatively moderates the effect of picture count on crowdfunding success. These findings show the significance of information description on crowdfunding success, bringing theoretical and practical insights for project creators.},

We test these research questions using data from 644 technological gadget projects posted on a popular crowdfunding website over two years. We further investigate our hypotheses using three laboratory studies where we replicate the above effects on backing intention of backers. Results suggest that positive framing does not have a direct effect on funding level, but on the other hand, negative framing does have a positive effect on funding level. Moreover, results indicate that public update positively affects funding level and increases the positive effect of negative framing on funding level. Results also show that the combination of positive framing and public update has a negative impact on funding level.

Specifically, two controlled experiments and an analysis of field data explore how prospective donors respond to fundraising campaign photos featuring either physical self-help, non-physical self-help, or no self-help. Results show that donors contribute more funds to campaigns that show victims engaged in physical self-help than to campaigns portraying victims engaged in non-physical self-help or no self-help. The findings also suggest that this influence is attributable to the sense of inspiration elicited by such images and is attenuated when the self-help behavior is perceived as inappropriate for the situation at hand.},

  abstract = {Recent research has emphasized that signaling clear membership in product categories influences how products perform. In this paper we focus on two shortcomings in the categorization literature. First, while prior literature has focused primarily on category labels as signals of categorical membership, other mechanisms that communicate association to a category--such as semantic networks and images--have been under-researched. We draw on the literature on multi-modal processing of information to explain how text-based mechanisms such as the use of labels and semantic networks differ from visual-based mechanisms such as the use of images. Second, the prior literature has overlooked the asymmetry in the effect of positive and negative labels on performance. We draw on an extensive literature within psychology to argue that negative labels have a stronger effect on performance than positive labels. Using original data from the crowdfunding website Indiegogo from 2010 to 2015, we find that both text-based mechanisms, semantic networks and labels, and visual mechanisms of signaling category membership are associated with performance. Our findings also suggest that images convey category membership by activating different cognitive structures than text. Furthermore, we find that labels with negative valence have a stronger effect on performance than positive labels. Our study theorizes and provides empirical support for a more complete understanding of how producers can signal categorical membership to shape the performance of their products.},

Some people call it digital distraction, but others describe it as the way things are done today. One of the deepest concerns expressed by many scientists and researchers is the attention span that is shrinking, people are jumping from one message to another or speaking to three people at the same time and sometimes they call themselves as multitasking wise kids of the modern age. Well, it is easy to understand that the speed of communication, travel and methods of transfer of speech and data have improved with innovative Technology, but the question is, are we allowing enough time at the receiving or sending end to complete or comprehend a message.

At the same time, creators may need to modify their campaign communication strategy depending on the product type they are raising funds for (i.e., tangible products or intangible services and experiences). However, research has not considered the possibility of product type moderating the effect of creators' campaign communication strategy on campaign success. Drawing on theoretical insights from the advertising and services communication literature and employing a dataset of over 8000 reward-based crowdfunding campaigns from kickstarter.com, the current study tests the moderating effect of product type. A computational algorithm deciphered creators' campaign communication strategy. The findings contribute to the literature by offering nuanced insights about the effects of creators' campaign communication strategy on the success of tangible product and intangible service and experience campaigns.},

However, as these signals are not always available, creators, especially new ones, must rely on other signals, such as narrative quality. Building on the emerging literature on rhetorical signaling, we investigate the moderating effect of narrative quality on the relationship between risk/reward rhetoric and crowdfunding success. We show that risk (reward) rhetoric negatively (positively) affects campaign success. Thereafter, we introduce two new signals (narrative structural quality and narrative wording quality). Using a sample of 331,060 Kickstarter campaigns from 2009 to 2018, we empirically show that the use of punctuation positively moderates the relationship be\- tween risk/reward rhetoric and success, whereas the use of informal language negatively moderates this rela\- tionship. Interestingly, this moderating effect is similar to that of traditional signals such as endorsement and past success.},

  abstract = {Background: Reward-based crowdfunding (RBCF) is an established funding mechanism for entrepreneurs, in which they present their ideas through campaign presentations to persuade backers. Compared to investors, who focus more on the merits of the information presented, crowdfunding backers pay attention to cues such as the entrepreneurs' characteristics and the appeal of the campaign. Accordingly, researchers investigated cues, i.e., snippets of information embedded within different communication modalities that facilitate the interpretation of the campaign and entrepreneur. Thus, knowledge of how cues affect decision-making and funding performance has become important for researchers and practitioners. However, current research often investigated cues in isolation that are fragmented across literature and does not provide a straightforward understanding of how cues embedded in campaign presentations affect funding performance. Method: This review synthesizes past RBCF literature to provide a comprehensive concept-centric categorization of how cues affect funding performance. Results: The review analyzed 71 articles and identified three main research topics, namely ``communication strategies'', ``perceived entrepreneurs' characteristics'', and ``appeal to emotions''. The review developed 14 corresponding concept-centric sub-categories of cues and reported their effects on funding performance (significant negative, non-significant, significant positive, inverted U-shaped). Votecounting shows that some sub-categories tend to have overall positive or negative effects, with first indications of an often-neglected inverted U-shape effect. Yet, the effect's direction is not straightforward for all sub-categories. Also, further research is necessary to explore what specific combinations of cues moderate, complement, or substitute for each other's effects, including non-linear assumptions. Also, there is room to investigate fruitful, not yet analyzed, cues and theoretical lenses. Conclusion: This review contributes to the RBCF literature by providing detailed insights into the effects of cues embedded within the campaign presentation on funding performance. Such a better understanding can benefit all involved parties.},

Some investors are concerned with the entrepreneurs' profiles, while others are more interested in the creativity behind the project or the idea. Most investors evaluate a project by referring to founder-generated content. Entrepreneurs then face the choice of emphasizing their own profiles or the project creativity within the limited narrative. Our study is thus motivated to examine how the emphasis of the text narratives affect the fundraising outcomes. We propose an improved deep learning model for text content emphasis (TCE) detection from various textual sources, including titles, blurbs, and detailed descriptions, and then estimate the impact of TCE on the success of fundraising campaigns. With data collected from public sources of Kickstarter platform, our empirical analyses demonstrate that TCE matters differently for various textual sources. It is more effective for the title and blurb to emphasize the entrepreneur profile, while the detailed description should highlight the idea creativity. Furthermore, for the detailed description, the entrepreneur profile has a more positive effect when it is placed at the beginning of the narrative. And the effects of entrepreneur-oriented narratives are more pronounced in these projects with more social connections. This study contributes to the understanding of TCE, entrepreneur profile disclosure, and social connection in economic exchanges in online crowdfunding.},

Many studies examined determinants of crowdfunding success, but little attention has been paid to the interaction between creators and backers. We examine effects of comment (including quantity, sentiment, and length) and reply (including ratio, length, and speed) to understand the importance of creator-backer interaction in crowdfunding success. A total of 959 projects from a major crowdfunding platform in China were collected and analyzed. The results indicate that comment quantity, comment score, reply length, and reply speed are positively associated with the fundraising success. In addition, comment sentiment positively moderates the effect of comment quantity on crowdfunding success. The findings demonstrate the importance of interaction between creators and backers in crowdfunding success, providing both theoretical and practical implications.},

  abstract = {Medical crowdfunding helps low-income patients raise money for medical treatment and has grown tremendously in recent years. The most appropriate messaging strategy for writing char\- itable appeals to attract donations remains unclear. This study fills this gap by drawing on Aristotle's three modes of persuasion to explore factors affecting willingness to donate to medical crowdfunding projects from three aspects: logos, pathos, and ethos. This study adopted a multimethod approach by conducting two laboratory experiments (N = 125 and N = 123) and a field study (N = 1645). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) in Study 1 showed that high information quality (F = 9.774, p = 0.002) and gain frame (F = 8.620, p = 0.004) have positive effects on the trustworthiness of the project initiator (ethos), which in turn promoting potential donors' will\- ingness to donate ({$\beta$} = 0.339, p = 0.001). Study 2 confirmed the findings about information quality in Study 1, and further show that there was no significant difference between gain-first and gain-last frame on trustworthiness and willingness to donate (p {$>$} 0.05). Then, information quality is further detailed into three sub-dimensions in Study 3: text length, number of images, and number of health-related words. The results of ordinary least squares (OLS) regression with robust standard error indicate that the text length ({$\beta$} = 0.350, p {$<$} 0.001) and number of images ({$\beta$} = 0.048, p {$<$} 0.001) positively influence donation behavior, but the opposite conclusion yields health-related words ({$\beta$} = -0.027, p {$<$} 0.01). This study provides theoretical insights into the role of medical crowdfunding charitable appeals by verifying the persuasion effects of rational, emotional, and credibility appeals. This study also contributes to persuasion theory by high\- lighting the role of emotional appeals and identifying the mediating impact of credibility appeals in the context of medical crowdfunding. This study also has important practical implications by guiding funders to write persuasive charity appeals that will attract the attention of potential donors.},

Yet the most appropriate message strategy for attracting these different types of backers remains unclear. To fill this gap, using insights into advertising appeals and the elaboration likelihood model (ELM), we propose a conceptual framework reflecting how the emphasis of the appeals in a crowdfunding message might influence support decisions by two types of backers: consumers and investors. Objective data from a crowdfunding website reveal that appeals that emphasize information (emotion) exert more positive persuasive effects on consumer (investment) backers than on investment (consumer) backers. When devising the appeal emphasis, entrepreneurs thus must make a trade-off while also considering contingent factors such as decision control, social orientation, and reward tangibility. The practical implications of these findings suggest that entrepreneurs should activate backers' information processing routes differentially, using distinct appeal emphases, rather than relying on an undifferentiated message strategy.},

Using webpages of a major crowdfunding platform (N = 4123), the author found that only a limited number of projects leveraged the benefits of embedding videos and pictures. Although having more videos and pictures generally predicted an increase in donation, the increase was unevenly distributed across different categories of projects. Meanwhile, topic modeling distinguished word clusters from description texts. While a variety of topic words relating to factual details positively predicted the fundraising outcomes, clusters featuring the overuse of requesting words such as ``help'', ``money'', and ``thank'' seemed to backfire. The findings shed light on the complex contingencies of communication modality effects across different types of projects and provide guidelines for more effective message design in crowdfunding campaigns.},

Thus, we focus on the moderating effect of text sentiment on the motivational cues in crowdfunding campaigns. We hypothesize that the sentiment of campaign narratives moderates the relationship between motivational cues and fundraising success. Data are selected from 270,000 campaigns of the crowdfunding website Indiegogo. Empirical analysis demonstrates that the sentiment strength positively moderates the effect of intrinsic motives on fundraising success but negatively moderates the impact of extrinsic motives on fundraising success. The findings provide managerial insights for practitioners to stimulate specified motives by using the narratives with proper sentiment strength.},

Project descriptions have the potential to influence backer funding decisions significantly, and creators have complete control over them, suggesting the relevance of this previously unexplored factor. A secondary data analysis of 245,704 online requests for new project funding indicates greater success for project descriptions that emphasize exploitation rather than exploration themes. A series of follow-up experiments also demonstrate that risk perceptions mediate decision-making processes, and that a person's power state is an important moderator of funding intentions. In particular, potential backers with less power are more likely to fund a project with an exploitation-focused description rather than one with an exploration focus. Conversely, backers with greater power perceive both project types as equally attractive, but they also are more likely to fund an explorative project than those with less power. These novel contributions help clarify how funding for startups varies as a function of specific word choices in funding requests, as well as the role of power in determining individual funding behaviors.},

  abstract = {We study how Airbnb property demand changed after the acquisition of verified images (taken by Airbnb's photographers) and explore what makes a good image for an Airbnb property. Using deep learning and difference-in-difference analyses on an Airbnb panel data set spanning 7,423 properties over 16 months, we find that properties with verified images had 8.98\% higher occupancy than properties without verified images (images taken by the host). To explore what constitutes a good image for an Airbnb property, we quantify 12 human-interpretable image attributes that pertain to three artistic aspects---composition, color, and the figure-ground relationship---and we find systematic differences between the verified and unverified images. We also predict the relationship between each of the 12 attributes and property demand, and we find that most of the correlations are significant and in the theorized direction. Our results provide actionable insights for both Airbnb photographers and amateur host photographers who wish to optimize their images. Our findings contribute to and bridge the literature on photography and marketing (e.g., staging), which often either ignores the demand side (photography) or does not systematically characterize the images (marketing).

  abstract = {Online crowdfunding platforms offer a valuable channel to raise funding for various philanthropic causes, and fundraisers need to understand how to present campaign appeals to motivate charity giving decisions. This study examines the relationship between multi-modal emotion expression in campaign messages and charity crowdfunding success. Specifically, we explore the interaction of two modalities, including the visual modality expressed through beneficiaries' face images and the verbal modality expressed through text descriptions. Using data collected from a leading charity crowdfunding platform, we find superiority of the verbal modality to the visual modality of emotion expression in explaining crowdfunding campaign success. In addition, emotion consistency between visual and verbal modalities helps mitigate the failure of online charity crowdfunding campaigns, suggesting a congruency effect. This study offers a new theoretical understanding of the role of multi-modal emotion expression in online charity crowdfunding campaigns and practical guidance on the design of effective campaign messages.},

  abstract = {This article focuses on entrepreneurs' self-funding behavior in the reward crowdfunding context and its relation to crowdfunding success. Theoretically anchoring our discussion in signaling theory, we argue that self-funding sends similar information to that conveyed by quick-fix bootstrapping efforts. Accordingly, we hypothesize that self-funding behavior is positively associated with crowdfunding success as it can help alleviate uncertainties around a fundraiser's intent and quality as perceived by prospective backers. To show this, we use a sample of 1,583 campaigns collected from Zhongchou, the largest Chinese rewardbased crowdfunding platform, to test our hypotheses. Our results demonstrate that entrepreneurs' direct self-funding is positively associated with crowdfunding success. Moreover, this effect is partially mediated by the quality of campaigns' content elements.},
